 TypeScript Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering the TypeScript programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient TypeScript developer.

## Resources

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

[TypeScript support for Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)

[TypeScript Support for Nuxt.js](https://typescript.nuxtjs.org)

[TypeScript Support for Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/typescript.html)

[TypeScript Support for React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript)

[TypeScript Support for Angular](https://angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration)

[Ionic/TypeScript Starter Project](http://justin-credible.github.io/Ionic-TypeScript-Starter/)

[GitHub Actions for JavaScript and TypeScript](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/github-actions-for-javascript-and-typescript)

## Tools

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a professional IDE for JavaScript(including support for both HTML and CSS) developed by JetBrains. WebStorm comes with intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error detection, powerful navigation and refactoring for JavaScript, TypeScript, stylesheet languages, and all the most popular frameworks([Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/#!), and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)).

[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) is a Visual Studio Extension for .NET Developers. It comes with code quality analysis, which is available in C#, VB.NET, XAML, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and XML. You'll know right away if your code needs to be improved. ReSharper is one of many powerful tools developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com).

[ts-migrate](https://github.com/airbnb/ts-migrate) is a tool for helping migrate code to TypeScript. It takes a JavaScript, or a partial TypeScript, project in and gives a compiling TypeScript project out. ts-migrate is intended to accelerate the TypeScript migration process. The resulting code will pass the build, but a followup is required to improve type safety.

[Deno](https://deno.land) is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

[gulp-typescript](https://github.com/ivogabe/gulp-typescript) is an TypeScript compiler for gulp with incremental compilation support.
